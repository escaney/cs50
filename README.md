Thanks to CS50 for this gem of a course! https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/weeks/0/

### Notes

Putting this up as I go through the problem sets. Hoping it can become a valuable resource for those taking the course with no prior CS knowledge.

NB: I'm new to C too but hoping that my prior js knowledge can help create some readable solutions 


### NB

In order to run .js solutions you'll need to run 

`node file.js`

Inside the parent folder of the file inside the command line
